        <p>
          Solar power provides one of the best ways to go green if you want a
          reliable alternative for power. Sparrow Electric believes that solar
          power should be affordable and attainable by every homeowner. Using
          solar energy to power your home is a responsible action that should be
          rewarded and encouraged. Thatâ€™s why we do everything to help people
          obtain financing, so they qualify to have residential solar panels
          installed on their homes.

          <p>
            The increasing cost of energy makes a significant impact on
            homeowners because it affects them financially. The usual process to
            switch to solar power includes a sizeable upfront investment that
            very few homeowners can make. The typical process for switching to
            solar power involves purchasing the panels and then paying for the
            installation. Although this is a step in the right direction, some
            property owners cannot afford the number of panels to completely
            replace paying the power company for a portion of their power. The
            most impactful way to go solar requires that you generate enough
            solar energy to stop paying the power company and make a lower
            monthly payment towards your panels.

            <p>
              Homeowners who prefer to own their solar panels typically opt for
              financing. This makes it so homeowners can switch to solar for no
              money down and make monthly payments on their system that are less
              than their power bill. Property owners begin saving on their
              monthly expenditures immediately because they eliminate their
              energy bill, plus the money they would have been throwing away at
              the power company is now being put towards owning their solar
              system. Solar power financing with Sparrow Electric allows
              homeowners to get the most value from their residential solar
              system. We designed our financing for homeowners looking to reap
              long-term savings rather than short-term cash flow.

            <h4>You Can Take Advantage Of Our Solar Process</h4>
            <p>
              Sparrow Electric has solar power financing options for homeowners
              that can't pay for the panels and the installation in cash.
              Whether or not they plan on going the solar power route, every
              property owner can benefit from familiarizing themselves with our
              financing options and how they work. Knowing that we help identify
              a payment option that enables a better long-term energy cost can
              make all the difference in whether or not they get new solar
              panels.

              Nationwide, the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is one of the
              primary incentives available to anyone interested in solar energy.
              The ITC tax credit allows you to deduct 26 percent of the cost of
              installing a solar system from your federal taxes. This incentive
              won't last forever - in 2023, the federal ITC steps down to 22
              percent and then goes away entirely for residential solar
              installations in 2024.
